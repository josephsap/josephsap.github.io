          <h3>Role: Development</h3>
        </header> 
        <p>I built the responsive website for Mullen's holiday card. It used the YouTube API to pull in a video which the user could interact with through a YouTube annotation.</p>
        <img src="images/makeitstop-main.jpg" />
        <p>I chose to use Backbone's views to deal with the different screens. This helped me fake autoplay the video by triggering a click on a custom play button.</p>
        <p>Another challenge was figuring out how to keep the video constrained to the screen without the footer overlapping it while maintaining the proper aspect ratio. Before I even started building, I had to research what was possible regarding interactions in YouTube videos across desktop and mobile devices and in Facebook. My findings impacted the design and concept quite a bit.</p>

          <h2>Jamba Juice App</h2>
          <h3>Roles: Prototyping/UI/UX/Strategy</h3>
        </header>
          <h4>Our challenge:</h4> 
            <p>During our first hour of school at BDW, <a href="http://www.neighboragency.com" target="_blank" class="link">Neighbor Agency</a> delivered a brief from their client, Jamba Juice. They needed a mobile app that reduces menu confusion and in-store wait time, which are two big problems facing customers and franchisees.
            </p>
          <h4>Research:</h4>
           <p>My group of three visited Jamba Juice stores, researched mobile apps, and questioned friends and family. We decided to go with a mood-based theme, concluding that consumers order based on a combination of how they are feeling and their taste preferences.</p>
          <h4>Prototyping:</h4>
           <p>Throughout the two weeks, we went through plenty of sketching, deliberation, and compromising. We made paper prototypes, wireframes, and used online prototyping tools. Throughout the process, we iterated over and over again. At the end of the two weeks the project culminated with a presentation. Neighbor Agency presented all of the designs to the client, and <strong>our concept was chosen as their favorite.</strong></p>

        <h2>Medicine + The Military</h2>
        <h3>Role: Lead Front-End Development, UX, Visual Design, Workflow Optimization</h3>
      </header> 
      <p>The Military is having trouble recruiting doctors, so my team is building an informative website to clarify the application process, drive interest, dispel myths, and ultimately increase the number of doctors joining the military.</p>
      <p>This was a project where I was able to show that I'm more than a developer. Once I was informed that I would be involved, I immediately insisted that the six key people building the site (me, UX, art director, designer, content, copy) work together early on and frequently. We did, and the result was a happy and impressed client and account team. We were able to show how a site's theme can be carried out through interaction design, and I created a demo to further illustrate the point to the client.</p>
      <p>I made many development decisions too. Since the timeline and budget were short, I chose to use Bootstrap to speed things up on my end. Content will be added to the site in the future, so the backend developer and I chose to use Drupal to make it easy for a copywriter to update the content without a developer's help. Since our primary target audience is college-age and tech-savvy, we chose to carry over mobile icons and interactions to the desktop (see the menu).</p>
      <img src="images/menuopen.png" />
      <p>The menu opens and closes on scroll.</p>
      <img src="images/menuclose.png" />
      <p>The UX designer and I also put together a round of testing using Mullen interns as subjects (they were part of our target audience) using paper prototypes of the site.</p>
      <p>Every animation is built with speed in mind. I'm animating properties that are easy for the browser to process, such as using translate instead of animating the top position.</p>
      <p>Technologies used: JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS, Bootstrap, Grunt.js, Modernizr, Drupal, Icon fonts</p>

        <h2>Today's Military Website</h2>
        <h3>Role: Development</h3>
      </header> 
      <p>One of Mullen's clients is the Department of Defense, and I helped develop a responsive site to inform someone considering joining the military of their options. I came in for the last five months of two-year process, taking over for another developer. I was responsible for the majority of the responsive CSS, the map implementation, and many JavaScript and CMS tasks.</p>
      <p>The main challenge for this project was re-writing many lines of CSS. I felt the site was built incorrectly, so I had to re-do a large amount of work. Why?</p> 
      <img src="images/bootcamp.jpg" alt="Today's Military" />
      <p>For example, in this section, with an image to the left and text to the right, the original developer placed the text to the right with padding, which on smaller screens, resulted in text wrapping below the image. I re-wrote all of these instances and floated each section to the left and right. In the process, I was also able to cut out many lines of code.</p>
      <p>Another significant task was implementing the interactive map of all the military bases around the world. (Click the image to see it on the live site.)</p>
      <a href="http://todaysmilitary.com/living/bases-around-the-world" target="_blank"><img src="images/map.jpg" alt="map"/></a>
      <p>This was another re-write, requiring me to remove 97% of the original code because it was crashing on iOS 7 and in IE8. I became quite familiar with the Google Maps docs and working with JavaScript objects.</p>
      <p>Technologies used: JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS, Google Maps API, Drupal, PHP</p>

          <h2>Cabinet Design</h2>
          <h3>Roles: Development/UX</h3>
        </header> 
        <p>This was a freelance front-end build for a design/video/branding shop. The design concept was theirs, and a couple of classmates and I worked together to bring it to life. We collaborated with the Cabinet team to enhance the user experience and refine the design.</p>
        <h4>Design Improvements:</h4>
        <p>Below is their intro screen which is an autoplay video. Originally, the bar with the logo and "Enter the Cabinet" was only visible on mouseover. I tested the site with some of our classmates and they didn't know what to do. I took this feedback to the client, proposed making the bar visible at all times, and they approved.</p> 
        <img src="images/cabinet-one.jpg" alt="Cabinet Website"/>
        <p>The Services screen below was essentially a list with a non-informative hover state. I suggested adding tooltips on hover with copy showing Cabinet's strengths in these areas. The tooltips added much-needed information and interactivity to the site.</p>

        </header> 
        <p>Inspired by unbaby.me, Seventh Generation asked Made Movement to create a Facebook app where users could bomb their friend's photos with images of a baby. I was asked to create a prototype of the masking feature which output the final coordinates and would "bounce" the image back if the user tried to position it outisde of the clipping mask.</p>
        <img src="images/sevgen-baby.jpg" />
        <h4>Process:</h4>
        <p>I created a "clipping mask" in PhotoShop then placed an image behind it. Since I had to get this project completed in a limited amount of time, I used jQuery UI's draggable feature, then added my own JavaScript to it. The final coordinates are output to the console, and the image automatically bounces back to cover the whole mask if it's out of bounds.</p>

          <h1>piq, a jukebox for social spaces</h1>
          <h2>Roles: Development/UX/Copywriting/Business Development</h2>
        </header> 
       <p>The second semester at BDW is called Startup, which is essentially an accelerator like TechStars. My team, piq, made a "jukebox". It is a hardeware device that plugs in to your speakers, and since it has WiFi, users can pull up the web app and choose what song plays next, creating a collaborative playlist. The prototype was built on a Raspberry Pi and the music comes from Spotify.</p>
       <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>I did whatever was needed including building and designing the marketing site, writing and editing, coordinating a Kickstarter video shoot, and plenty of user testing and research.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/piq-hero-img.png" alt="Website hero image" /> 
          <figcaption>A graphic I made explaining piq.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Taking something from concept to reality was in invaluable experience. Learning where to spend your time and what to do next were the major takeaways. There's no doubt this experience will benefit me whenever I have to work in a team.</p>
       <h3>Design Case Study:</h3>
        <img src="images/search.png" alt="piq UI"/>
        <p>Above is an early mock for the app's user interface. It features two sliders that default to display five songs and five artists. The image on the right is my design which defaults to a long scrolling list of songs, artists, or albums. We had users searching for songs and wondering why they were only getting five results. My design was passed over in favor of the sliding design, which I felt wasn't intuitive. My design was eventually validated when one of our design teachers sketched my concept without having seen it. <strong>What did I learn? Next time, I have to push harder for my design, back it up with research, and show my reasoning.</strong></p>

      <h3>Outcome:</h3>
        <p>The team won PitchFest, which was the semester-ending competition amongst the six BDW Startup teams. The Kickstarter campaign fell well short of its $55,000 goal.</p>

      <img src="images/nike-app.jpg" alt="Wirestone/BDW"/>
      <p>Keeping in mind soccer fans' team loyalty and the fact that not everyone will be able to travel to Brazil for the World Cup, we created a team-centric experience that anyone, anywhere could participate in. The first part is the app that changes your phone to your team's colors, gives you team-related content, and helps you find where your fellow fans are watching the game. Of course, you can buy Nike product right in the app.</p>
      <p>If a fan is in Brazil watching the matches, they can interact with the vantage wall using the Kinect. If you stand in front of the wall with the app on, your body would show up and act like a clipping mask, offering up team-related content. It's interactive, meaning you can see past World Cup highlights, get stats, and see what's happening on social media. Then, if you stand close enough to a fan of a different team, the overlapping content would show the history between both teams. Nike product would be integrated as a timeline so you could view the soccer shoes' evolution since its inception.</p>

      <p>This is a side project that was done with the help of Jeremy from Mode Set, a development studio in Denver. It started out as a "candy machine", but I made all of the objects change color randomly every half second. I used JavaScript's protypal inheritance, loops, array, objects, etc. to make this absolutely useless thing. It was fun and a great way to build skills.</p>

      <h2>Roles: Development/UX</h2>
      <a href="http://thisisstory.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/story-cover.jpg"></a>
      <p>Story, a store in Manhattan switches out their merch, fixtures, and changes their theme about every three months, like a magazine. Their current "story" is Made in America, which includes Made Collection as a collaborator.</p>
      <p>Their current site wasn't doing a good job telling their story. My design partner and I determined we had to higlight their previous content which we felt conveyed the uniqueness of this store better than an about page could. We also tried to keep the editorial theme throughout, as it's the general idea underlying the brand.</p>
      <p>I built a fully responsive Wordpress site with custom into animation and some customized Wordpress plugins. For UX, I was able to bring the human-centered perspective to the development and design process. For example, we debated heavily about what the site visitor should see on the first page, and how we should lay out the site's current and future content.</p>
      <p>Tools used: Wordpress, jQuery, icoMoon icon fonts, SASS, responsive design.</p>
